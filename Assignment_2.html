    <p>Tree Essay- Trees are our best friends because they clean the air we breathe
        .<br> Likewise, they also clean the water and soil and ultimately make the earth a better<br> place. It is also a fact that people who live near trees are healthier, fit, and happier <br>than people who do not.</p>
