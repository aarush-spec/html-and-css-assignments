    <h3>1. Great Wall Of China</h3>
    <div id="first">
        <p>
            Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest building-construction projects,<br> the Great Wall of China is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese study, <br> claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. <br>Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel walls for lengthy stretches. In addition,<br> watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness.<br> Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids, the wall largely failed to provide actual security. Instead, <br>scholars have noted that it served more as “political propaganda.”

        <h3>2. Chichén Itzá</h3>
        <p>Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE.<br> Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important monuments and temples <br>were built. Among the most notable is the stepped <br>pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza. A testament to the<br> Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar year.<br> During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance<br> of a serpent slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. Life there was not all work and science,<br> however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the Americas.<br> On that field the residents played a ritual ball game popular throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.</p>

        <h3>3. Petra</h3>
        <p>The ancient city of Petra, Jordan,<br> is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places <br>where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this<br> time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans<br> chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they <br>constructed a water system that allowed for lush gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population of 30,000.<br> The city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted. A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty,<br> and after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned. Although rediscovered in 1912,<br> it was largely ignored by archaeologists until the late 20th century, and many questions remain about the city.</p>

        <h3>4. Machu Picchu</h3>
        <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, <br>who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although<br> that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins <br>of the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage site, while some believe<br> it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently should not be is the site of a beer commercial. In 2000 a crane being used for such<br> an ad fell and cracked a monument.) What is known is that Machu Picchu is one of the few major pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact.<br> Despite its relative isolation high in the Andes Mountains, it features agricultural terraces, plazas, residential areas, and temples.</p>

       <h3>5. Christ the Redeemer</h3>
       <p>Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro.<br>Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a <br>“tide of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski.<br>Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not <br>including its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the largest Art<br> Deco sculpture in the world. Christ the Redeemer is made of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six million tiles.<br> Somewhat disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in 2014 the tip of Jesus’s right thumb was damaged during a storm.</p>

        <h3>6. Colosseum</h3>
        <p>The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the<br> amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000<br> spectators, who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though men battling animals was also common.<br> In addition, water was sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements. However, the belief that Christians were <br>martyred there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated. According to some estimates, about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum. <br>Additionally, so many animals were captured and then killed there that certain species reportedly became extinct.</p>

        <h3>7. Taj Mahal</h3>
        <p>This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic monuments and is <br>perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal<br> (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct <br>the complex, which includes an immense garden with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious<br> stones in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four smaller domes. According to some reports,<br> Shah Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum made out of black marble. However, he was deposed by one of his sons before any work began.</p>
